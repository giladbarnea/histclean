1. If the user requests a new feature, it's often multiple features packed into a single request. Break down the request using the following method:
	1.1. If the feature is complex, break it down into the individual features that make it up.
	1.2. Focus on each individual feature and ask: "What's practically required to implement this feature successfully?"
	1.3. Based on your answer, break down each feature into smaller tasks.
	1.4. Present the user with the task list and wait for their approval.
2. After each change, run histclean-check.sh to format and check for errors.
